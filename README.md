My name is TonyGuo.

Currently, I am a software engineer at Xiaomi. Prior to that, I was a technical lead in the Xperiaâ„¢ Camera Application team at Sony, China.

I have been programming for more than 10 years, and I still love to code and occasionally post some programming ramblings on [my personal blog](https://kwapoong.github.io).
