Hi, My name is Tony Guo. Currently, I am a software engineer at Xiaomi. Prior to that, I was a technical lead in the Xperia™ Camera Application team at Sony, China. I have been programming for more than 10 years, and I still love to code and occasionally post some programming ramblings on [kwapoong.github.io](https://kwapoong.github.io) or [tonykwok.github.io](https://tonykwok.github.io)
