Hi there!

My name is Tony Guo. I am a software engineer.  Currently, I'm working at Xiaomi. Prior to that, I was a technical lead in the Xperia™ Camera Application team at Sony, China.

I have been programming for more than 10 years, and I still love to code and occasionally post some programming ramblings on my [personal website](https://kwapoong.github.io).
